- The program reads the matrix from "input.dat" file, solves eigenvalue problem for the matrix and prints eigenvalues in the form (real, imag)
- sample_output.dat contains the program output for some matrix

### Eigens_makefile

- The same program with subroutines reading matrix from file, finding eigenvalues, and printing eigenvalues in seperate module
- The makefile contaitns two builds with release and debug modes

### MPI_Integral
